[Introduction](#introduction) | [Overview](#overview) | [Local Testnet](#localtest) | [Public Testnet](#publictest) | [Misc](#misc)


Remme Protocol is a blockchain-based protocol focused on digital key and identity lifecycle management to resolve issues related to cybersecurity, IoT connectivity, data integrity, digital copyright protection, transparency etc.

Some of the groundbreaking features include:

1. Free Rate Limited Transactions
1. Low Latency Block confirmation (0.5 seconds)
1. Attribute-based identity and access control
1. Designed for Sparse Header Light Client Validation
1. Time Delay Security
1. Hierarchical Role Based Permissions
1. Support for Biometric Hardware Secured Keys (e.g. Apple Secure Enclave)
1. Designed for Parallel Execution of Context Free Validation Logic
1. Designed for Inter Blockchain Communication

# <a name="overview"></a> Get familiar with EOSIO architecture
To get a general architecture overview and understanding of how the basic blockchain components interact, please refer to the [developer documentation](https://developers.eos.io/eosio-home/docs/10-big-picture).

# <a name="localtest"></a>Getting started with a Local Testnet
If you are a developer, depending on your context, you would probably need an independent local network to work on your dApp. Instructions detailing the process of getting the software, building it, running a simple local test network that produces blocks, account creation and uploading a sample contract to the blockchain can be found on the [Developer Portal](https://docs.remme.io/getting-started.html).


# <a name="publictest"></a>Getting started with a Public Testnet

## Testnet token faucet bot
[The faucet bot](https://t.me/RemmeProtocolTestnetFaucetBot) helps you with getting set up and creating an account with some tokens on it. With the help of this bot you will get the following data about your testnet account:

- Account name
- Public and private keys to be able to create transactions

## Run your own node
To spin up an independent node that is connected to the Public Testnet, refer to [this blog post](https://remme.io/blog/remchain-testnet-is-live).

## Testnet explorer
All the transactions that occur on the testchain and the information about all the accounts on testnet are [visible at the portal](https://testchain.remme.io/).

This portal also lets you perform:

- Token transfers
- Stake/unstake resources
- Vote for producers
- Token Swap between the testnets of ETH and REM
