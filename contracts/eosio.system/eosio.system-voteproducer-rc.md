# Action - `{{ voteproducer }}`

## Description

The intent of the `{{ voteproducer }}` action is to cast a valid vote for up to 30 BP candidates. 

As an authorized party I {{ signer }} wish to vote on behalf of {{ voter }} in favor of the block producer candidates {{ producers }} with a voting weight equal to all tokens currently owned by {{ voter }} and staked for CPU or bandwidth. 

If I am not the beneficial owner of these shares I stipulate I have proof that Iâ€™ve been authorized to vote these shares by their beneficial owner(s). 

I stipulate I have not and will not accept anything of value in exchange for these votes, on penalty of confiscation of these tokens, and other penalties. 

I acknowledge that using any system of automatic voting, re-voting, or vote refreshing, or allowing such a system to be used on my behalf or on behalf of another, is forbidden and doing so violates this contract.
