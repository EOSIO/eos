Furthermore, Members voluntarily consent for all Members to permanently and irrevocably retain a copy, analyze, and distribute all broadcast transactions and derivative information.\n\n# Article XIII - Informed Consent\nAll service providers who produce tools to facilitate the construction and signing of transactions on behalf of other Members shall present to said other Members the full Ricardian contract terms of this Constitution and other referenced contracts. Service providers shall be liable for losses resulting from failure to disclose the full Ricardian contract terms to users.\n\n# Article XIV - Severability\nIf any part of this Constitution is declared unenforceable or invalid, the remainder will continue to be valid and enforceable.\n\n# Article XV - Termination of Agreement\nA Member is automatically released from all revocable obligations under this Constitution 3 years after the last transaction signed by that Member is incorporated into the blockchain. After 3 years of inactivity an account may be put up for auction and the proceeds distributed to all Members according to the system contract provisions then in effect for such redistribution.\n\n# Article XVI - Developer Liability\nMembers agree to hold software developers harmless for unintentional mistakes made in the expression of contractual intent, whether or not said mistakes were due to actual or perceived negligence.\n\n# Article XVII - Consideration\nAll rights and obligations under this Constitution are mutual and reciprocal and of equally significant value and cost to all parties.\n\n# Article XVIII - Acceptance\nA contract is deemed accepted when a member signs a transaction which incorporates a TAPOS proof of a block whose implied state incorporates an ABI of said contract and said transaction is incorporated into the blockchain.\n\n# Article XIX - Counterparts\nThis Constitution may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall constitute a duplicate original, but all counterparts together shall constitute a single agreement.\n\n# Article XX - Interim Constitution\nThis constitution is interim and is intended to remain in effect until a permanent constitution is written and ratified in a referendum.\n"
