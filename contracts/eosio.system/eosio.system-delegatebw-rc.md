_Intent: stake tokens for bandwidth and/or CPU and optionally transfer ownership_

As an authorized party I {{ signer }} wish to stake {{ asset-stake_cpu_quantity }} for CPU and {{ asset-stake_net_quantity }} for bandwidth from the liquid tokens of {{ account_name-from }} for the use of delegatee {{ account_name-to }}.
