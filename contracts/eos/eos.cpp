      <h3> Required Authority </h3>

      This action requires the authority of the `from` account.

      <h3>Required Scope </h3>

      This action requires access to `from` and `to` account scopes. It does not require
      access to the `eos` scope which means that multiple transfers can execute in parallel
      as long as they don't have any overlapping scopes.

      <h3> Required Recipients </h3>

      This message requires that the accounts `from` and `to` are listed in the required recipients. This ensures
      other contracts are notified anytime EOS tokens are transferred.
