    *  an equal value of both sides of the order book and giving the issuer
    *  the initial shares in that orderbook.
    *
    *  To prevent exessive rounding errors, the initial deposit should include
    *  a sizeable quantity of both the base and quote currencies and the exchange
    *  shares should have a quantity 100x the quantity of the largest initial
    *  deposit.
    *
    *  Users must deposit funds into the exchange before they can trade on the
    *  exchange.
    *
    *  Each time an exchange is created a new currency for that exchanges market
    *  maker is also created. This currencies supply and symbol must be unique and
    *  it uses the currency contract's tables to manage it.
