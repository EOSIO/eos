## Transfer Terms & Conditions

I, {{from}}, certify the following to be true to the best of my knowledge:

1. I know the person(s) who transferred {{quantity}} to '{{from}}'.
2. I know the owner(s) of the '{{to}}' account.
3. I certify that {{quantity}} is not the proceeds of fraudulent or violent activities.
4. I certify that, to the best of my knowledge, {{to}} is not supporting initiation of violence against others.
5. I have disclosed any contractual terms & conditions with respect to {{quantity}} to {{to}}.

I understand that funds transfers are not reversible after the {{transaction.delay}} seconds or other delay as configured by {{from}}'s permissions.

If this action fails to be irreversibly confirmed after receiving goods or services from '{{to}}', I agree to either return the goods or services or resend {{quantity}} in a timely manner.
