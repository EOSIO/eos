DICE
-----------------

This contract implements a simple DICE game between two players with 50/50 odds of winning. 

Before playing all players deposit funds into their @dice account just like the @exchange contract

1. Player 1 proposes to bet 1 EOS and submits SHA256(secret1)
2. Player 2 proposes to bet 1 EOS and submits SHA256(secret2)

Because Player 1 and 2 bet equal amounts their orders are matched and the game begins.

3. A Player reveales their secret
4. A 5 minute deadline starts whereby the first to reveal automatically wins unless the other player reveales
5. The other player reveals and a winner is chosen and paid based upon the value of sha256( cat(secret1,secret2) )
6. After the deadline anyone can trigger a default claim and the rewards


Economic Incentive for Interface Developers
-----------------

A variation on this game would be to add an additional information on offer creation that will get paid
a commission when the player wins. With this commission in place there is financial incentive for a
service provider to continue to execute the game in a timely manner as well as provide quality and
entertaining interfaces on top of this game.


Other Games
-----------
This same basic model can be used to build more robust games.


Potential Vulnerabilities
-------
1. Block Producers may exclude reveal transaction 
2. Losers may force winner to wait 5 minutes to get rewards
3. Service providers may fail to auto-reveal on your behalf
4. You may lose internet connectivity mid-game
5. A blockhain reorganization could cause some havock if secrets are revealed too quickly
    - @dice could protect users by rejecting reveals until a game creation is irreversible (about 45 seconds max)
    - users could take risk themselves by deciding how many confirmations are required
    - for small amounts it probably doesn't matter 
    - under normal operation of DPOS chains there are few if any chain reorganizations
