/**

 *  @brief APIs that store and retreive data on the blockchain
 *  @ingroup contractdev
 *
 *  EOS.IO organizes data according to the following broad structure:
 *
 *  - **scope** - an account where the data is stored
 *     - **code** - the account name which has write permission 
 *        - **table** - a name for the table that is being stored
 *           - **record** - a row in the table
 *
 *  Every transaction specifies the set of valid scopes that may be read and/or written
 *  to. The code that is running determines what can be written to; therefore, write operations
 *  do not allow you to specify/configure the code. 
 *
 *  @note Attempts to read and/or write outside the valid scope and/or code sections will 
 *  cause your transaction to fail.
 *
 *
 *  @section tabletypes Table Types
 *  There are several supported table types identified by the number and
 *  size of the index.  
 *
 *  1. @ref dbi64 
 *  2. @ref dbi128i128
 *
 *  The database APIs assume that the first bytes of each record represent
 *  the primary and/or secondary keys followed by an arbitrary amount of data.
 *
 *  The @ref databaseCpp provides a simple interface for storing any fixed-size struct as
 *  a database row.

 *
 *  @param scope - the account where table data will be found
 *  @param code  - the code which owns the table

 *
 *  @return the total number of bytes read or -1 for "not found" or "end" where bytes

 *  ```
 *     struct Record {

 *
 *  You can iterate over these indicies with primary index sorting records by { primary, secondary } and
 *  the secondary index sorting records by { secondary, primary }.  This means that duplicates of the primary or
 *  secondary values are allowed so long as there are no duplicates of the combination {primary, secondary}.
