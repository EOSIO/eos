    * @brief Define API for querying action properties
    *
    *
    * A EOS.IO action has the following abstract structure:
    *
    * ```
    *   struct action {
    *     scope_name scope; // the contract defining the primary code to execute for code/type
    *     action_name name; // the action to be taken
    *     permission_level[] authorization; // the accounts and permission levels provided
    *     bytes data; // opaque data processed by code
    *   };
    * ```
    *
    * This API enables your contract to inspect the fields on the current action and act accordingly.
    *
    * Example:
    * @code
    * // Assume this action is used for the following examples:
    * // {
    * //  "code": "eos",
    * //  "type": "transfer",
    * //  "authorization": [{ "account": "inita", "permission": "active" }],
    * //  "data": {
    * //    "from": "inita",
    * //    "to": "initb",
    * //    "amount": 1000
    * //  }
    * // }
    *
    * char buffer[128];
    * uint32_t total = read_action(buffer, 5); // buffer contains the content of the action up to 5 bytes
    * print(total); // Output: 5
    *
    * uint32_t msgsize = action_size();
    * print(msgsize); // Output: size of the above action's data field
    *
    * require_recipient(N(initc)); // initc account will be notified for this action
    *
    * require_auth(N(inita)); // Do nothing since inita exists in the auth list
    * require_auth(N(initb)); // Throws an exception
    *
    * account_name code = current_receiver();
    * print(Name(code)); // Output: eos
    *
    * eos_assert(Name(current_receiver()) === "eos", "This action expects to be received by eos"); // Do nothing
    * eos_assert(Name(current_receiver()) === "inita", "This action expects to be received by inita"); // Throws exception and roll back transfer transaction
    *
    * print(now()); // Output: timestamp of last accepted block
    *
