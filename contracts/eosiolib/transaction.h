    * @brief Defines API for sending transactions and inline actions
    *
    *
    * Deferred transactions will not be processed until a future block.  They
    * can therefore have no effect on the success or failure of their parent
    * transaction so long as they appear well formed.  If any other condition
    * causes the parent transaction to be marked as failing, then the deferred
    * transaction will never be processed.
    *
    * Deferred transactions must adhere to the permissions available to the
    * parent transaction or, in the future, delegated to the contract account
    * for future use.
    *
    * An inline message allows one contract to send another contract a message
    * which is processed immediately after the current message's processing
    * ends such that the success or failure of the parent transaction is
    * dependent on the success of the message. If an inline message fails in
    * processing then the whole tree of transactions and actions rooted in the
    * block will be marked as failing and none of effects on the database will
    * persist.
    *
    * Inline actions and Deferred transactions must adhere to the permissions
    * available to the parent transaction or, in the future, delegated to the
    * contract account for future use.
