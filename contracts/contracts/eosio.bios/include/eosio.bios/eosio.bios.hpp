/**
 * EOSIO Contracts
 *
 * @details The design of the EOSIO blockchain calls for a number of smart contracts that are run at a
 * privileged permission level in order to support functions such as block producer registration and
 * voting, token staking for CPU and network bandwidth, RAM purchasing, multi-sig, etc. These smart
 * contracts are referred to as the system, token, msig and wrap (formerly known as sudo) contracts.
 *
 * This repository contains examples of these privileged contracts that are useful when deploying,
 * managing, and/or using an EOSIO blockchain. They are provided for reference purposes:
 * - eosio.bios
 * - eosio.system
 * - eosio.msig
 * - eosio.wrap
 *
 * The following unprivileged contract(s) are also part of the system.
 * - eosio.token
