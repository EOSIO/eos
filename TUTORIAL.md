## EOSIO Developer Tutorial 

The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to setup a local blockchain 
that can be used to experiment with smart contracts. The first part of this
tutorial will focus on:

1. Starting a Node
2. Creating a Wallet
3. Creating Accounts
4. Deploying Contracts
5. Interacting with Contracts

The second part of this tutorial will walk you through creating and deploying
your own contracts.

This tutorial assumes that you have installed eosio and that `nodeos` and 
`cleos` are in your path. 


## Starting a Private Blockchain

You can start your own single-node blockchain with this single command:

```
$ nodeos -e -p eosio --plugin eosio::wallet_api_plugin --plugin eosio::chain_api_plugin --plugin eosio::account_history_api_plugin 
...
eosio generated block 046b9984... #101527 @ 2018-04-01T14:24:58.000 with 0 trxs
eosio generated block 5e527ee2... #101528 @ 2018-04-01T14:24:58.500 with 0 trxs

```

This command sets many flags and loads some optional plugins which we will need for
the rest of this tutorial. Assuming everything worked properly you should see a 
block generation message every 0.5 seconds.  

```
eosio generated block 046b9984... #101527 @ 2018-04-01T14:24:58.000 with 0 trxs
```

This means your local blockchain is live, producing blocks, and ready to be used.

For more information about the arguments to `nodeos` you can
use:

```
nodes --help
```

## Creating a Wallet

A wallet is a repository of private keys necessary to authorize actions on the blockchain.
These keys are stored on disk encrypted using a password generated for you. This password
should be stored in a secure password manager.

```
$ cleos wallet create
Creating wallet: default
Save password to use in the future to unlock this wallet.
Without password imported keys will not be retrievable.
"PW5JuBXoXJ8JHiCTXfXcYuJabjF9f9UNNqHJjqDVY7igVffe3pXub"
```

For the purpose of this simple development environment, your wallet is being managed by
your local `nodeos` via the `eosio::wallet_api_plugin` we enabled when we started `nodeos`. 
Any time you restart `nodeos` you will have to unlock your wallet before you can use the
keys within.

```
$ cleos wallet unlock --password PW5JuBXoXJ8JHiCTXfXcYuJabjF9f9UNNqHJjqDVY7igVffe3pXub
Unlocked: default
```

It is generally not secure to use your password directly on the commandline where it gets
logged to your bash history, so you could also unlock in interactive mode:

```
$ cleos wallet unlock
password:
```

For security purposes it is generally best to leave your wallet locked when you are not
using it.  To lock you wallet without shutting down `nodeos` you can do:

```
$ cleos wallet lock
Locked: default
```

You will need you wallet unlocked for the rest of this tutorial.

All new blockchains start out with a master key for the sole initial account, `eosio`. To
interact with the blockchain you will need to import this initial account's private key 
into your wallet.

Import the master key for the eosio account into your wallet.

```
$ cleos wallet import 5KQwrPbwdL6PhXujxW37FSSQZ1JiwsST4cqQzDeyXtP79zkvFD3
imported private key for: EOS6MRyAjQq8ud7hVNYcfnVPJqcVpscN5So8BhtHuGYqET5GDW5CV
```

## Load the Bios Contract

Now that we have a wallet with the key for the `eosio` loaded we can set a default system contract.
For the purposes of development, the default `eosio.bios` contract can be used. This contract enables
you have direct control over the resoruce allocation of other accounts and access other privileged 
api calls. In a public blockchain, this contract would manage the staking and unstaking of tokens to
reserve bandwidth for cpu and network activity and memory for contracts. 

The eosio.bios contract can be found in the contracts folder of yoru eosio source code. This command assumes
it is being executed from the root of the eosio source, but you could execute it from anywhere by specifying 
the full path to ${EOSIO_SOURCE}/contracts/eosio.bios.

```
$ cleos set contract eosio contracts/eosio.bios -p eosio

#         eosio <= eosio::setcode               {"account":"eosio","vmtype":0,"vmversion":0,"code":"0061736d0100000001ab011960037f7e7f0060057f7e7e7e...

```

`cleos` generated a transaction with two actions, `eosio::setcode` and `eosio::setabi`.  

The code defines how the contract runs and the abi describes how to convert between binary and json
representations of the arguments. While an abi is technically optional, all of the eosio tooling depends upon
it for ease of use.  

Any time you execute a transaction you will see output like:
```
executed transaction: 414cf0dc7740d22474992779b2416b0eabdbc91522c16521307dd682051af083  4068 bytes  10000 cycles
#         eosio <= eosio::setcode               {"account":"eosio","vmtype":0,"vmversion":0,"code":"0061736d0100000001ab011960037f7e7f0060057f7e7e7e...
#         eosio <= eosio::setabi                {"account":"eosio","abi":{"types":[],"structs":[{"name":"set_account_limits","base":"","fields":[{"n...
```

This can be read as: The action 'setcode' as defined by `eosio` was executed by `eosio` contract with `{args...}`.

```
#         ${executeor} <= ${contract}:${action} ${args...}
> console output from this execution, if any
```

As we will see in a bit, actions can be processed by more than one contract.

The last argument to this call was `-p eosio`, this tells cleos to sign this 
action with the active authority of the `eosio` account which will use the key
we imported earlier. 


## Create an Account

Now that we have setup the basic system contract, we can start to create our own accounts.

To do this we first generate a key for the account. 

```
$ cleos create key
Private key: 5Jmsawgsp1tQ3GD6JyGCwy1dcvqKZgX6ugMVMdjirx85iv5VyPR
Public key: EOS7ijWCBmoXBi3CgtK7DJxentZZeTkeUnaSDvyro9dq7Sd1C3dC4

```

Then we import this key into our wallet:
```
$ cleos wallet import 5Jmsawgsp1tQ3GD6JyGCwy1dcvqKZgX6ugMVMdjirx85iv5VyPR
imported private key for: EOS7ijWCBmoXBi3CgtK7DJxentZZeTkeUnaSDvyro9dq7Sd1C3dC4
```

Keys are not automatically added to a wallet, so skipping this step could result in
losing control of your account.

## Create two User Accounts

Next we will create two accounts, `user` and `tester`, using the key we created and imported above.

```
$ cleos create account eosio user  EOS7ijWCBmoXBi3CgtK7DJxentZZeTkeUnaSDvyro9dq7Sd1C3dC4 EOS7ijWCBmoXBi3CgtK7DJxentZZeTkeUnaSDvyro9dq7Sd1C3dC4
executed transaction: 8aedb926cc1ca31642ada8daf4350833c95cbe98b869230f44da76d70f6d6242  364 bytes  1000 cycles
#         eosio <= eosio::newaccount            {"creator":"eosio","name":"user","owner":{"threshold":1,"keys":[{"key":"EOS7ijWCBmoXBi3CgtK7DJxentZZ...

$ cleos create account eosio tester EOS7ijWCBmoXBi3CgtK7DJxentZZeTkeUnaSDvyro9dq7Sd1C3dC4 EOS7ijWCBmoXBi3CgtK7DJxentZZeTkeUnaSDvyro9dq7Sd1C3dC4
executed transaction: 414cf0dc7740d22474992779b2416b0eabdbc91522c16521307dd682051af083 366 bytes  1000 cycles
#         eosio <= eosio::newaccount            {"creator":"eosio","name":"tester","owner":{"threshold":1,"keys":[{"key":"EOS7ijWCBmoXBi3CgtK7DJxentZZ...
```

Because we are using the `eosio::account_history_api_plugin` we can query all accounts that are controlled by our key:

```
$ cleos get accounts EOS7ijWCBmoXBi3CgtK7DJxentZZeTkeUnaSDvyro9dq7Sd1C3dC4
{
  "account_names": [
    "tester",
    "user"
  ]
}
```


## Create Token Contract

At this stage the blockchain doesn't do much, so lets deploy the `eosio.token` contract. This
contract enables the creation of many different tokens all running on the same contract but
potentially managed by different users. 

Before we can deploy the token contract we must create an account to deploy it to.

```
$ cleos create account eosio eosio.token  EOS7ijWCBmoXBi3CgtK7DJxentZZeTkeUnaSDvyro9dq7Sd1C3dC4 EOS7ijWCBmoXBi3CgtK7DJxentZZeTkeUnaSDvyro9dq7Sd1C3dC4
...
```

Then we can deploy the contract which can be found in ${EOSIO_SOURCE}/contracts/eosio.token

```

$ cleos set contract eosio.token contracts/eosio.token -p eosio.token
Reading WAST...

#         eosio <= eosio::setcode               {"account":"eosio.token","vmtype":0,"vmversion":0,"code":"0061736d0100000001ce011d60067f7e7f7f7f7f00...
#         eosio <= eosio::setabi                {"account":"eosio.token","abi":{"types":[],"structs":[{"name":"transfer","base":"","fields":[{"name"...
```

### Create the EOS Token

You can view the interface to `eosio.token` as defined by contracts/eosio.token/eosio.token.hpp:
```
   void create( account_name issuer,
                asset        maximum_supply,
                uint8_t      can_freeze,
                uint8_t      can_recall,
                uint8_t      can_whitelist );


   void issue( account_name to, asset quantity, string memo );

   void transfer( account_name from,
                  account_name to,
                  asset        quantity,
                  string       memo );
```

To create a new token we must call the `create(...)` action with the proper arguments. This command
will use the symbol of the maximum supply to uniquely identify this token from other tokens. The issuer
will be the one with authority to call issue and or perform other actions such as freezing, recalling, and
whitelisting of owners.  

The concise way to call this method, using positional arguments:
```
$ cleos push action eosio.token create '[ "eosio", "1000000000.0000 EOS", 0, 0, 0]' -p eosio.token
executed transaction: 0e49a421f6e75f4c5e09dd738a02d3f51bd18a0cf31894f68d335cd70d9c0e12  260 bytes  1000 cycles
#   eosio.token <= eosio.token::create          {"issuer":"eosio","maximum_supply":"1000000000.0000 EOS","can_freeze":0,"can_recall":0,"can_whitelis...

```

Alternatively a more verbose way to call this method, using named arguments:

```
$ cleos push action eosio.token create '{"issuer":"eosio", "maximum_supply":"1000000000.0000 EOS", "can_freeze":0, "can_recall":0, "can_whitelist":0}' -p eosio.token
executed transaction: 0e49a421f6e75f4c5e09dd738a02d3f51bd18a0cf31894f68d335cd70d9c0e12  260 bytes  1000 cycles
#   eosio.token <= eosio.token::create          {"issuer":"eosio","maximum_supply":"1000000000.0000 EOS","can_freeze":0,"can_recall":0,"can_whitelis...
```


This command created a new token `EOS` with a pecision of 4 decimials and a maximum 
supply of 1000000000.0000 EOS. 

In order to create this token we required the permission of the `eosio.token` contract 
because it "owns" the symbol namespace (e.g. "EOS"). Future versions of this contract 
may allow other parties to buy symbol names automatically.  For this reason we must
pass `-p eosio.token` to authorize this call.

### Issue Tokens to User

Now that we have created the token, the issuer can issue new tokens to the account `user` we created earlier. 

We will use the positional calling convention (vs named args).

```
$ cleos push action eosio.token issue '[ "user", "100.0000 EOS", "memo" ]' -p eosio
executed transaction: 822a607a9196112831ecc2dc14ffb1722634f1749f3ac18b73ffacd41160b019  268 bytes  1000 cycles
#   eosio.token <= eosio.token::issue           {"to":"user","quantity":"100.0000 EOS","memo":"memo"}
>> issue
#   eosio.token <= eosio.token::transfer        {"from":"eosio","to":"user","quantity":"100.0000 EOS","memo":"memo"}
>> transfer
#         eosio <= eosio.token::transfer        {"from":"eosio","to":"user","quantity":"100.0000 EOS","memo":"memo"}
#          user <= eosio.token::transfer        {"from":"eosio","to":"user","quantity":"100.0000 EOS","memo":"memo"}
```

This time the output contains several different actions, issue and 3 transfers. While the only action we signed was
`issue`, the `issue` action performed an "inline transfer" and the "inline transfer" notified the sender and receiver
accounts. The output indicates all of the action handlers that were called, the order they were called in, and 
whether or not any output was generated by the action.

Technically the eosio.token contract could have skipped the `inline transfer` and opted to just modify the balances
directly, but in this case the eosio.token contract is following our token convention which requires that all account
balances be derivable by the sum of the transfer actions that reference them. It also requires that the sender and
receiver of funds be notified so they can automate handling deposits and withdraws. 

If you want to see the actual transaction that was broadcast you can use the `-d -j` options to indicate 
"don't broadcast" and "return transaction as json".

```
$ cleos push action eosio.token issue '["user", "100.0000 EOS", "memo"]' -p eosio -d -j
{
  "expiration": "2018-04-01T15:20:44",
  "region": 0,
  "ref_block_num": 42580,
  "ref_block_prefix": 3987474256,
  "net_usage_words": 21,
  "kcpu_usage": 1000,
  "delay_sec": 0,
  "context_free_actions": [],
  "actions": [{
      "account": "eosio.token",
      "name": "issue",
      "authorization": [{
          "actor": "eosio",
          "permission": "active"
        }
      ],
      "data": "00000000007015d640420f000000000004454f5300000000046d656d6f"
    }
  ],
  "signatures": [
    "EOSJzPywCKsgBitRh9kxFNeMJc8BeD6QZLagtXzmdS2ib5gKTeELiVxXvcnrdRUiY3ExP9saVkdkzvUNyRZSXj2CLJnj7U42H"
  ],
  "context_free_data": []
}
```

### Transfer Tokens to Tester

Now that account `user` has some tokens, we will transfer them to account `tester` and use the permission `-p user`.

```
$ cleos push action eosio.token transfer '[ "user", "tester", "25.0000 EOS", "m" ]' -p user
executed transaction: 06d0a99652c11637230d08a207520bf38066b8817ef7cafaab2f0344aafd7018  268 bytes  1000 cycles
#   eosio.token <= eosio.token::transfer        {"from":"user","to":"tester","quantity":"25.0000 EOS","memo":"m"}
>> transfer
#          user <= eosio.token::transfer        {"from":"user","to":"tester","quantity":"25.0000 EOS","memo":"m"}
#        tester <= eosio.token::transfer        {"from":"user","to":"tester","quantity":"25.0000 EOS","memo":"m"}
```


## Hello World Contract

The next step we will create our first "hello world" contract. Create a new folder called "hello" and then create
a file "hello/hello.cpp" with the following contents:

#### hello/hello.cpp
```
#include <eosiolib/eosio.hpp>
#include <eosiolib/print.hpp>
using namespace eosio;

class hello : public eosio::contract {
  public:
      using contract::contract;

      /// @abi action 
      void hi( account_name user ) {
         print( "Hello, ", name{user} );
      }
};

EOSIO_ABI( hello, (hi) )
```

Then you can compile it to web assmebly (.wast) like so:
```
$ eosiocpp -o hello.wast hello.cpp
```

Then you can generate the abi:

```
$ eosiocpp -g hello.abi hello.cpp
Generated hello.abi
```

Then we create the account and upload contract

```
$ cleos create account eosio hello.code EOS7ijWCBmoXBi3CgtK7DJxentZZeTkeUnaSDvyro9dq7Sd1C3dC4 EOS7ijWCBmoXBi3CgtK7DJxentZZeTkeUnaSDvyro9dq7Sd1C3dC4
...
$ cleos set contract hello.code ../hello -p hello.code
...
```

Now we can run the contract:

```
$ cleos push action hello.code hi '["user"]' -p user
executed transaction: 4c10c1426c16b1656e802f3302677594731b380b18a44851d38e8b5275072857  244 bytes  1000 cycles
#    hello.code <= hello.code::hi               {"user":"user"}
>> Hello, user
```

At this time the contract allows anyone to authorize it, we could also say:

```
$ cleos push action hello.code hi '["user"]' -p tester
executed transaction: 28d92256c8ffd8b0255be324e4596b7c745f50f85722d0c4400471bc184b9a16  244 bytes  1000 cycles
#    hello.code <= hello.code::hi               {"user":"user"}
>> Hello, user
```

In this case tester is the one who authorized it and user is just an argument.  If we want our contact to authenticate the
user we are sying "hi" to, then we need to modify the contract:

We update the hi() function:
```
void hi( account_name user ) {
   require_auth( user );
   print( "Hello, ", name{user} );
}
```

Now if we attempt to mismatch the user and the authority the contract will throw an error:
```
$ cleos push action hello.code hi '["tester"]' -p user
Error 3030001: missing required authority
Ensure that you have the related authority inside your transaction!;
If you are currently using 'cleos push action' command, try to add the relevant authority using -p option.
Error Details:
missing authority of tester
```

We can fix this by giving the permission of tester:

```
$ cleos push action hello.code hi '["tester"]' -p tester
executed transaction: 235bd766c2097f4a698cfb948eb2e709532df8d18458b92c9c6aae74ed8e4518  244 bytes  1000 cycles
#    hello.code <= hello.code::hi               {"user":"tester"}
>> Hello, tester
```
