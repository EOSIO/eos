This document describes how to use the new start_testnet.pl script to provision and launch a number of eosd nodes to form a test network.

These nodes my exist all on local host, or they may be distributed across a cluster of hosts, assuming you have ssh access to each host. EOS must be built or installed on each.

There is a new app, launcher, which is able to configure and deploy an arbitrary number of test net nodes.

usage:
start_testnet.pl [--nodes=<n>] [--pnodes=<n>] [--topo=<"ring"|"star"|filename>] [--time-stamp=<time>]

where:
--nodes=n (default = 1) sets the number of eosd instances to launch
--pnodes=n (default = 1) sets the number nodes that will also be producers
--topo=s (default = ring) sets the network topology to either a ring shape or a star shape
--time-stamp=s (default "") sets the timestamp in UTC for the genesis block. use "now" to mean the current time.


node topology file:

node <alias>
  eos-root-dir
  data-dir
  hostname/ip
  p2p-port
  https-port
  ws-port
  peer-list [<alias>, <alias>, ...]
  producers [<name>, <name>, ...]
  want-producers (yes/no)

node <alias>
...

To deploy




-----------------------
Functionality that remains to be implemented: caching signed transactions then purging them on a schedule. Sending summaries of blocks rather than whole blocks. Optimizing the routing between nodes. Failover during new node synchronization if a peer fails to respond timely enough.

Also need to prepare tests that are distributed, deterministic, and repeatable.
