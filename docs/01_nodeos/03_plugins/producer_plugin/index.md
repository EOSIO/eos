# producer_plugin

## Description

The `producer_plugin` loads functionality required for a node to produce blocks.

[[info]]
| Additional configuration is required to produce blocks. Please read [Configuring Block Producing Node](https://developers.eos.io/eosio-nodeos/docs/environment-producing-node).

## Usage

```sh
# config.ini
plugin = eosio::producer_plugin [options]

# nodeos startup params
$ nodeos ... -- plugin eosio::producer_plugin [options]
```

## Options

These can be specified from both the `nodeos` command-line or the `config.ini` file:

```console
