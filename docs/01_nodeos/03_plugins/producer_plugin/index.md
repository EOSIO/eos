## Description

The `producer_plugin` loads functionality required for a node to produce blocks.

[[info]]
| Additional configuration is required to produce blocks. Please read [Configuring Block Producing Node](../../02_usage/02_node-setups/00_producing-node.md).

## Usage

```console
# config.ini
plugin = eosio::producer_plugin [options]
```
```sh
# nodeos startup params
nodeos ... -- plugin eosio::producer_plugin [options]
```

## Options

These can be specified from both the `nodeos` command-line or the `config.ini` file:

```console

## Dependencies

* [`chain_plugin`](../chain_plugin/index.md)

## The priority of transaction

You can give one of the transaction types priority over another when the producer plugin has a queue of transactions pending.

The option below sets the ratio between the incoming transaction and the deferred transaction:

```console
  --incoming-defer-ratio arg (=1)       
```

By default value of `1`, the `producer` plugin processes one incoming transaction per deferred transaction. When `arg` sets to `10`, the `producer` plugin processes 10 incoming transactions per deferred transaction. 

If the `arg` is set to a sufficiently large number, the plugin always processes the incoming transaction first until the queue of the incoming transactions is empty. Respectively, if the `arg` is 0, the `producer` plugin processes the deferred transactions queue first.
