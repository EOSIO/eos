<!-- # How to create a portable snapshot with full state history -->

## Goal

This procedure creates a database containing the chain state, with full history since genesis state.

## Before you begin

* Make sure [EOSIO is installed](../../../00_install/index.md).
* Learn about [Using Nodeos](../../02_usage/index.md).
* Get familiar with [state_history](../../03_plugins/state_history_plugin/index.md) plugin.

## Steps

1. Enable the `producer_api_plugin` on a node with full state-history.

[[caution | Caution when using `producer_api_plugin`]]
| Either use a firewall to block access to `http-server-address`, or change it to `localhost:8888` to disable remote access.

2. Create a portable snapshot:
```sh
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8888/v1/producer/create_snapshot | json_pp
```

3. Wait for `nodeos` to process several blocks after the snapshot completed. The goal is for the state-history files to contain at least 1 more block than the portable snapshot has, and for the `blocks.log` file to contain the block after it has become irreversible.

[[info | Note]]
| If the block included in the portable snapshot is forked out, then the snapshot will be invalid. Repeat this process if this happens.

4. Stop `nodeos`.

5. Make backups of:
   * The newly-created portable snapshot (`data/snapshots/snapshot-xxxxxxx.bin`)
   * The contents of `data/state-history`:
     * `chain_state_history.log`
     * `trace_history.log`
     * `chain_state_history.index`: optional. Restoring will take longer without this file.
     * `trace_history.index`: optional. Restoring will take longer without this file.
   * Optional: the contents of `data/blocks`, but excluding `data/blocks/reversible`.
