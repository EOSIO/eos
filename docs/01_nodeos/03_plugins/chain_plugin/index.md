## Description

The `chain_plugin` is a core plugin required to process and aggregate chain data on an EOSIO node.

## Usage

```console
# config.ini
plugin = eosio::chain_plugin
[options]
```
```sh
# command-line
nodeos ... --plugin eosio::chain_plugin [operations] [options]
```

## Operations

These can only be specified from the `nodeos` command-line:

## Options

These can be specified from both the `nodeos` command-line or the `config.ini` file:

```console
Config Options for eosio::chain_plugin:

  --blocks-dir arg (="blocks")          the location of the blocks directory 
                                        (absolute path or relative to 
                                        application data dir)
  --blocks-log-stride arg (=4294967295)
                                        split the block log file when the head
                                        block number is the multiple of the
                                        stride. When the stride is reached, the
                                        current block log and index will be
                                        renamed '<blocks-retained-dir>/blocks-
                                        <start num>-<end num>.log/index' and a
                                        new current block log and index will be
                                        created with the most recent block. All
                                        files following this format will be
                                        used to construct an extended block log
  --max-retained-block-files arg (=10)  the maximum number of blocks files to
                                        retain so that the blocks in those
                                        files can be queried. When the number
                                        is reached, the oldest block file would
                                        be moved to archive dir or deleted if
                                        the archive dir is empty. The retained
                                        block log files should not be

                                        directory (absolute path or relative to
                                        blocks dir). If the value is empty, it
                                        is set to the value of blocks dir.
  --blocks-archive-dir (="archive")     the location of the blocks archive
                                        directory (absolute path or relative to
                                        blocks dir). If the value is empty,
                                        blocks files beyond the retained limit
                                        will be deleted. All files in the
                                        archive directory are completely under
                                        user's control, i.e. they won't be

                                        application config dir)
  --checkpoint arg                      Pairs of [BLOCK_NUM,BLOCK_ID] that

                                        and if this threshold is exceeded,
                                        the transaction will subjectively fail.
