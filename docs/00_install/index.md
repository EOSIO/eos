content_title: EOSIO Software Installation
---

There are various ways to install and use the EOSIO software:

* [Install EOSIO Prebuilt Binaries](00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md)
* [Build EOSIO from Source](01_build-from-source/index.md)

[[info]]
| If you are new to EOSIO, it is recommended that you install the [EOSIO Prebuilt Binaries](00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md), then proceed to the [Getting Started](https://developers.eos.io/eosio-home/docs/) section of the [EOSIO Developer Portal](https://developers.eos.io/). If you are an advanced developer, a block producer, or no binaries are available for your platform, you may need to [Build EOSIO from source](01_build-from-source/index.md) instead.

1. Amazon Linux 2
2. CentOS 7
3. Ubuntu 16.04
