[[info | Did you know?]]
| Shell scripts automate the process of building, installing, testing, and uninstalling the EOSIO software and dependencies.

To build EOSIO from the source code using shell scripts, visit the sections below:

1. [Download EOSIO Source](01_download-eosio-source.md)
2. [Build EOSIO Binaries](02_build-eosio-binaries.md)
3. [Install EOSIO Binaries](03_install-eosio-binaries.md)
4. [Test EOSIO Binaries](04_test-eosio-binaries.md)
5. [Uninstall EOSIO](05_uninstall-eosio.md)

[[info | Building EOSIO is for Advanced Developers]]
| If you are new to EOSIO, it is recommended that you install the [EOSIO Prebuilt Binaries](../../00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md) instead of building from source.
