If you have previously built APIFINY from source and now wish to install the prebuilt binaries, or to build from source again, it is recommended to run the `apifiny_uninstall.sh` script within the `apifiny/scripts` folder:

```sh
$ cd ~/apifiny/apifiny
$ sudo ./scripts/apifiny_uninstall.sh
```

[[info | Uninstall Dependencies]]
| The uninstall script will also prompt the user to uninstall APIFINY dependencies. This is recommended if installing prebuilt APIFINY binaries or building APIFINY for the first time.
