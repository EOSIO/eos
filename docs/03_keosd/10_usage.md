content_title: Keosd Usage

[[info | Recommended Usage]]
| For most users, the easiest way to use `keosd` is to have `cleos` launch it automatically. Wallet files will be created in the default directory (`~/eosio-wallet`).

## Launching keosd manually

`keosd` can be launched manually from the terminal by running:

```sh
$ keosd
```

By default, `keosd` creates the folder `~/eosio-wallet` and populates it with a basic `config.ini` file.  The location of the config file can be specified on the command line using the `--config-dir` argument.  The configuration file contains the HTTP server endpoint for incoming HTTP connections and other parameters for cross-origin resource sharing.

[[info | Wallet Location]]
| The location of the wallet data folder can be specified on the command line with the `--data-dir` option.

## Auto-locking

By default, `keosd` is set to lock your wallet after 15 minutes of inactivity. This is configurable in the `config.ini` by setting the timeout seconds in `unlock-timeout`. Setting it to 0 will cause `keosd` to always lock your wallet.

## Stopping keosd

The most effective way to stop `keosd` is to find the keosd process and send a SIGTERM signal to it.

## Other options

For a list of all commands known to `keosd`, simply run it with no arguments:

```sh
$ keosd --help
```

```console
