## Goal

Query infomation of an EOSIO account

## Before you begin

* Install the currently supported version of `cleos`

[[info | Note]]
| The cleos tool is bundled with the EOSIO software. [Installing EOSIO](../../00_install/index.md) will also install the cleos tool. 

* Acquire functional understanding of [EOSIO Accounts and Permissions](https://developers.eos.io/welcome/v2.1/protocol/accounts_and_permissions)


## Steps

Execute the command below:

```sh
cleos get account ACCOUNT_NAME
```
Where ACCOUNT_NAME = name of the existing account in the EOSIO blockchain.

**Example Output**

[[info | Account Fields]]
| Depending on the EOSIO network you are connected, you might see different fields associated with an account. That depends on which system contract has been deployed on the network.
