## Goal

Unstake resource from your account

Beware that only the account which originally delegated resource can undelegate

## Before you begin

* Install the currently supported version of cleos

* Ensure the reference system contracts from `eosio.contracts` repository is deployed and used to manage system resources

* Understand the following:
  * What is an account
  * What is network bandwidth
  * What is CPU bandwidth

## Steps

Unstake 0.01 SYS CPU bandwidth form account `alice`:

```shell
cleos system undelegatebw alice alice "0.01 SYS" "0 SYS"
```

You should see something below:

```shell
executed transaction: e7e7edb6c5556de933f9d663fea8b4a9cd56ece6ff2cebf056ddd0835efa6606  184 bytes  452 us
