## Introduction

`cleos` is a command line tool that interfaces with the REST API exposed by `nodeos`. Developers can also use `cleos` to deploy and test EOSIO smart contracts.

## Installation

`cleos` is distributed as part of the [EOSIO software suite](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/blob/master/README.md). To install `cleos` just visit the [EOSIO Software Installation](../00_install/index.md) section.

## Using Cleos

To use `cleos`, you need the end point (IP address and port number) of a running `nodeos` instance. Also, the `nodeos` instance must be configured to load the `eosio::chain_api_plugin` when launched. This allows `nodeos` to respond to the RPC requests coming from `cleos`.

### Cleos Commands

For a list of all `cleos` commands, run:

```sh
$ cleos --help
```

```console

### Cleos Subcommands

To get help with any particular subcommand, run `cleos SUBCOMMAND --help`. For instance:

```sh
$ cleos create --help
```

```console
Create various items, on and off the blockchain
Usage: cleos create SUBCOMMAND

Subcommands:
  key                         Create a new keypair and print the public and private keys
  account                     Create a new account on the blockchain
                              (assumes system contract does not restrict RAM usage)
```

`cleos` can also provide usage help for subcommands within subcommands. For instance:

```sh
$ cleos create account --help
```

```console
Create a new account on the blockchain (assumes system contract does not restrict RAM usage)
Usage: cleos create account [OPTIONS] creator name OwnerKey [ActiveKey]

Positionals:
  creator TEXT                The name of the account creating the new account (required)
  name TEXT                   The name of the new account (required)
  OwnerKey TEXT               The owner public key or permission level for the new account (required)
  ActiveKey TEXT              The active public key or permission level for the new account

Options:
  -h,--help                   Print this help message and exit
  -x,--expiration             set the time in seconds before a transaction expires, defaults to 30s
  -f,--force-unique           force the transaction to be unique. this will consume extra bandwidth and remove any protections against accidently issuing the same transaction multiple times
  -s,--skip-sign              Specify if unlocked wallet keys should be used to sign transaction
  -j,--json                   print result as json
  --json-file TEXT            save result in json format into a file
  -d,--dont-broadcast         don't broadcast transaction to the network (just print to stdout)
  --return-packed             used in conjunction with --dont-broadcast to get the packed transaction

  --use-old-rpc               use old RPC push_transaction, rather than new RPC send_transaction
  -p,--permission TEXT ...    An account and permission level to authorize, as in 'account@permission' (defaults to 'creator@active')
  --max-cpu-usage-ms UINT     set an upper limit on the milliseconds of cpu usage budget, for the execution of the transaction (defaults to 0 which means no limit)
  --max-net-usage UINT        set an upper limit on the net usage budget, in bytes, for the transaction (defaults to 0 which means no limit)
  --delay-sec UINT            set the delay_sec seconds, defaults to 0s
```

## Cleos Example

The following `cleos` command creates a local wallet named `mywallet` and displays the password to the screen:

```sh
$ cleos wallet create -n mywallet --to-console
```

```console
Creating wallet: mywallet
Save password to use in the future to unlock this wallet.
Without password imported keys will not be retrievable.
