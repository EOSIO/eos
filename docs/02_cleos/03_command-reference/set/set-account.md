## Description
set parameters dealing with account permissions

[[info | JSON input]]
| This command involves specifying JSON input which depends on underlying class definitions. Therefore, such JSON input is subject to change in future versions of the EOSIO software.

## Positionals
- `account` _TEXT_ - The account to set/delete a permission authority for
- `permission` _TEXT_ - The permission name to set/delete an authority for
- `authority` _TEXT_ - [delete] NULL, [create/update] public key, JSON string, or filename defining the authority
- `parent` _TEXT_ - [create] The permission name of this parents permission (Defaults to: "active")
## Options

`-h,--help` Print this help message and exit

`--add-code` [code] add 'eosio.code' permission to specified permission authority

`--remove-code` [code] remove 'eosio.code' permission from specified permission authority

`-x,--expiration` _TEXT_ - set the time in seconds before a transaction expires, defaults to 30s

`-f,--force-unique` - force the transaction to be unique. this will consume extra bandwidth and remove any protections against accidently issuing the same transaction multiple times

`-s,--skip-sign` Specify if unlocked wallet keys should be used to sign transaction

`-d,--dont-broadcast` - Don't broadcast transaction to the network (just print to stdout)

`-r,--ref-block` _TEXT_         set the reference block num or block id used for TAPOS (Transaction as Proof-of-Stake)

`-p,--permission`  _TEXT_ - An account and permission level to authorize, as in 'account@permission' (defaults to 'account@active')

`--max-cpu-usage-ms` _UINT_ - set an upper limit on the milliseconds of cpu usage budget, for the execution of the transaction (defaults to 0 which means no limit)

`--max-net-usage` _UINT_ - set an upper limit on the net usage budget, in bytes, for the transaction (defaults to 0 which means no limit)

`--delay-sec` _UINT_ - set the delay_sec seconds, defaults to 0s

## Command
To modify the permissions of an account, you must have the authority over the account and the permission of which you are modifying.

The first example associates a new key to the active permissions of an account.

```sh
cleos set account permission test active '{"threshold":1,"keys":[{"key":"EOS8X7Mp7apQWtL6T2sfSZzBcQNUqZB7tARFEm9gA9Tn9nbMdsvBB","weight":1}],"accounts":[{"permission":{"actor":"acc2","permission":"active"},"weight":50}]}' owner
```
This second example modifies the same account permission, but removes the key set in the last example, and grants active authority of the test account to another account.

```sh
cleos set account permission test active '{"threshold":1,"keys":[],"accounts":[{"permission":{"actor":"acc1","permission":"active"},"weight":50},{"permission":{"actor":"sandwich","permission":"active"},"weight":1}]}' owner
```

The third example demonstrates how to set up permissions for multisig.

```sh
cleos set account permission test active '{"threshold" : 100, "keys" : [{"key":"EOS8X7Mp7apQWtL6T2sfSZzBcQNUqZB7tARFEm9gA9Tn9nbMdsvBB","weight":25}], "accounts" : [{"permission":{"actor":"sandwich","permission":"active"},"weight":75}]}' owner
```
The JSON object used in this command is actually composed of two different types of objects

The authority JSON object ...

```json
{
  "threshold"       : 100,    /*An integer that defines cumulative signature weight required for authorization*/
  "keys"            : [],     /*An array made up of individual permissions defined with an EOS PUBLIC KEY*/
  "accounts"        : []      /*An array made up of individual permissions defined with an EOS ACCOUNT*/
}
```
...which includes one or more permissions objects.

```json
/*Set Permission with Key*/
{
  "permission" : {
    "key"           : "EOS8X7Mp7apQWtL6T2sfSZzBcQNUqZB7tARFEm9gA9Tn9nbMdsvBB",
    "permission"    : "active"
  },
  weight            : 25      /*Set the weight of a signature from this permission*/
}

/*Set Permission with Account*/
{
  "permission" : {
    "account"       : "sandwich",
    "permission"    : "active"
  },
  weight            : 75      /*Set the weight of a signature from this permission*/
}
```
