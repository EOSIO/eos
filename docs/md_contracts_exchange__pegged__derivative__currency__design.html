<div class="contents">
<div class="textblock"><p><a class="el" href="struct_a.html">A</a> currency is designed to be a fungible and non-callable asset. <a class="el" href="struct_a.html">A</a> pegged Derivative currency, such as BitUSD, is backed by a cryptocurrency held as collateral. The "issuer" is "short" the dollar and extra-long the cryptocurrency. The buyer is simply long the dollar.</p>
<h2>Background </h2>
<p>BitShares created the first working pegged asset system by allowing anyone to take out a short position by posting collateral and issuing BitUSD at a minimum 1.5:1 collateral:debt ratio. The <b>least collateralized position</b> was forced to provide liquidity for BitUSD holders any time the market price fell more than a couple percent below the dollar (if the BitUSD holder opted to use forced liquidation).</p>
<p>To prevent abuse of the price feed, all forced liquidation was delayed.</p>
<p>In the event of a "black swan" all shorts have their positions liquidated at the price feed and all holders of BitUSD are only promised a fixed redemption rate.</p>
<p>There are several problems with this design:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There is very <b>poor liquidity</b> in the BitUSD / BitShares market creating <b>large spreads</b></li>
<li>The shorts take all the risk and only profit when the price of BitShares rises</li>
<li>Blackswans are perpetual and very disruptive.</li>
<li>It is "every short for themselves"</li>
<li>Due to the risk/reward ratio the supply can be limited</li>
<li>The <b>collateral requirements</b> limit opportunity for leverage.</li>
</ol>
<h2>New Approach </h2>
<p>We present a new approach to pegged assets where the short-positions cooperate to provide the service of a pegged asset with <b>high liquidity</b>. They make money by encouraging people to trade their pegged asset and earning income <b>from the trading fees rather than seeking heavy leverage</b> in a speculative market. They also generate money by earning interest on personal short positions.</p>
<h2>The Setup Process </h2>
<p>An initial user deposits a Collateral Currency (<a class="el" href="struct_c.html">C</a>) into an smart contract and provides the initial price feed. <a class="el" href="struct_a.html">A</a> new Debt token (<a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a>) is issued based upon the price feed and a 1.5:1 <a class="el" href="struct_c.html">C</a>:<a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a> ratio and the issued tokens are deposited into the <b>Bancor market maker</b>. At this point in time there is 0 leverage by the market maker because no <a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a> have been sold. The initial user is also issued exchange tokens (<a class="el" href="struct_e.html">E</a>) in the market maker.</p>
<p>At this point people can buy <a class="el" href="struct_e.html">E</a> or <a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a> and the Bancor algorithm will provide liquidity between <a class="el" href="struct_c.html">C</a>, <a class="el" href="struct_e.html">E</a>, and <a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a>. Due to the fees charged by the the market maker the value of <a class="el" href="struct_e.html">E</a> will increase in terms of <a class="el" href="struct_c.html">C</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>Collateral currency = Smart Token/reserve of parent currency</p>
<p>Issued tokens = Bounty Tokens (distributed to early holders / community supporters)</p>
<p>Collateral <a class="el" href="class_ratio.html">Ratio</a> (<a class="el" href="struct_c.html">C</a>:<a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a>) = reciprocal of Loan-to-Value <a class="el" href="class_ratio.html">Ratio</a> (LTV) </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Maintaining the Peg </h2>
<p>To maximize the utility of the <a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a> token, the market maker needs to maintain a <b>narrow trading range</b> of <a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a> vs the Dollar. The more <b>consistant and reliable this trading range</b> is, the more people (arbitrageur) will be willing to hold and trade <a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a>. There are several situations that can occur:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p class="startli"><a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a> is trading above a dollar +5%</p>
<p class="startli">a. Maker is fully collateralized <code><a class="el" href="struct_c.html">C</a>:<a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a>&gt;1.5</code> </p><pre class="fragment">- issue new D and deposit into maker such that collateral ratio is 1.5:1
</pre><p> b. Maker is not fully collateralized <code><a class="el" href="struct_c.html">C</a>:<a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a>&lt;1.5</code> </p><pre class="fragment">- adjust the maker weights to lower the redemption prices (defending capital of maker), arbitrageur will probably prevent this reality.
</pre></li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>Marker Weights = Connector Weights (in Bancor)</p>
<p>Redemption Price: The price at which a bond may be repurchased by the issuer before maturity </p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li><p class="startli"><a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a> is selling for less than a dollar -5%</p>
<p class="startli">a. Maker is fully collateralized <code><a class="el" href="struct_c.html">C</a>:<a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a>&gt;1.5</code> </p><pre class="fragment">- adjust the maker weights to increase redemption prices 
</pre><p> b. Maker is under collateralized <code><a class="el" href="struct_c.html">C</a>:<a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a>&lt;1.5</code> </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">- stop E -&gt; C and E -&gt; D trades.</div><div class="line">- offer bonus on C-&gt;E and D-&gt;E trades.</div><div class="line">- on D-&gt;E conversions take received D out of circulation rather than add to the market maker</div><div class="line">- on C&lt;-&gt;D conversion continue as normal</div><div class="line">- stop attempting adjusting maker ratio to defend the price feed and let the price rise until above +1%</div></div><!-- fragment --></li>
</ol>
<p><a class="el" href="struct_value.html">Value</a> of <a class="el" href="struct_e.html">E</a> = <a class="el" href="struct_c.html">C</a> - <a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a> where <a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a> == all in circulation, so E-&gt;<a class="el" href="struct_c.html">C</a> conversions should always assume all outstanding <a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a> was <b>settled at current maker price</b>. The result of such a conversion will <b>raise the collateral ratio</b>, unless they are forced to buy and retire some <a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a> at the current ratio. The algorithm must ensure the individual selling <a class="el" href="struct_e.html">E</a> doesn't leave those holding <a class="el" href="struct_e.html">E</a> worse-off from a D/E perspective (doesnot reduce <a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a> to a large extent). An individual buying <a class="el" href="struct_e.html">E</a> will create new <a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a> to maintain the same D/E ratio.</p>
<p>This implies that when value of all outstanding <a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a> is greater than all <a class="el" href="struct_c.html">C</a> that <a class="el" href="struct_e.html">E</a> cannot be sold until the network generates <b>enough in trading fees</b> to recaptialize the market. This is like a company with more debt than equity not allowing buybacks. In fact, <b><a class="el" href="struct_e.html">E</a> should not be sellable any time the collateral ratio falls below 1.5:1</b>.</p>
<p>BitShares is typical <b>margin call</b> territory, but holders of <a class="el" href="struct_e.html">E</a> have a chance at future liquidity if the situation improves. While <a class="el" href="struct_e.html">E</a> is not sellable, <a class="el" href="struct_e.html">E</a> can be purchased at a 10% discount to its theoretical value, this will dilute existing holders of <a class="el" href="struct_e.html">E</a> but will raise capital and hopefully move <a class="el" href="struct_e.html">E</a> holders closer to eventual liquidity.</p>
<h2>Adjusting Bancor Ratios by Price Feed </h2>
<p>The price feed informs the algorithm of significant deviations between the Bancor effective price and the target peg. The price feed is necessarily a lagging indicator and may also factor in natural spreads between different exchanges. Therefore, the price feed shall have no impact unless there is a significant deviation (5%). When such a deviation occurs, the ratio is automatically adjusted to 4%.</p>
<p>In other words, the price feed keeps the maker in the "channel" but does not attempt to set the real-time prices. If there is a sudden change and the price feed differs from maker by 50% then after the adjustment it will still differ by 4%.</p>

<h2>Summary </h2>
<p>Under this model holders of <a class="el" href="struct_e.html">E</a> are short the dollar and make money to recollateralize their positions via market activity. Anyone selling <a class="el" href="struct_e.html">E</a> must <b>realize the losses as a result of being short</b>. Anyone buying <a class="el" href="struct_e.html">E</a> can get in to take their place at the current collateral ratio.</p>
<p>The value of <a class="el" href="struct_e.html">E</a> is equal to the value of a <b>margin postion</b>. Anyone can buy <a class="el" href="struct_e.html">E</a> for a combination <a class="el" href="struct_c.html">C</a> and <a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a> equal to the current collateral ratio.</p>
<p>Anyone may sell <a class="el" href="struct_e.html">E</a> for a personal margin position with equal ratio of <a class="el" href="struct_c.html">C</a> and <a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a>. Anyone may buy <a class="el" href="struct_e.html">E</a> with a personal margin position.</p>
<p>If they only have <a class="el" href="struct_c.html">C</a>, then they must use some of <a class="el" href="struct_c.html">C</a> to buy <a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a> first (which will move the price). If they only have <a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a>, then they must use some of <a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a> to buy <a class="el" href="struct_c.html">C</a> first (which will also move the price).</p>
<p>Anyone can buy and sell <a class="el" href="struct_e.html">E</a> based upon Bancor balances of <a class="el" href="struct_c.html">C</a> and (all <a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a>), they must sell their <a class="el" href="struct_e.html">E</a> for a combination of <a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a> and <a class="el" href="struct_c.html">C</a> at current ratio, then sell the <a class="el" href="struct_c.html">C</a> or <a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a> for the other.</p>
<p>Anytime collateral level falls below 1.5 selling <a class="el" href="struct_e.html">E</a> is blocked and buying of <a class="el" href="struct_e.html">E</a> is given a 10% bonus. Anyone can convert <a class="el" href="struct_d.html">D</a>&lt;-&gt;<a class="el" href="struct_c.html">C</a> using Bancor maker configured to maintain price within +/- 5% of the price feed. </p>
