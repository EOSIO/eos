    * These fields are used for the producer scheduling algorithm which uses a virtual race to ensure that runner-up
    * producers are given proportional time for producing blocks. Producers are constantly running a racetrack of
    * length config::ProducerRaceLapLength, at a speed equal to the number of votes they have received. Runner-up
    * producers, who lack sufficient votes to get in as a top-N voted producer, get scheduled to produce a block every
    * time they finish the race. The race algorithm ensures that runner-up producers are scheduled with a frequency
    * proportional to their relative vote tallies; i.e. a runner-up with more votes is scheduled more often than one
    * with fewer votes, but all runners-up with any votes will theoretically be scheduled eventually.
    *
    * Whenever a runner-up producer needs to be scheduled, the one projected to finish the race next is taken, with the
    * caveat that any producers already scheduled for other reasons (such as being a top-N voted producer) cannot be
    * scheduled a second time in the same round, and thus they are skipped/ignored when looking for the producer
    * projected to finish next. After selecting the runner-up for scheduling, the global current race time is updated
    * to the point at which the winner crossed the finish line (i.e. his position is zero: he is now beginning his next
    * lap). Furthermore, all producers which crossed the finish line ahead of the winner, but were ineligible to win as
    * they were already scheduled in the next round, are effectively held at the finish line until the winner crosses,
    * so their positions are all also set to zero.
    *
    * Every time the number of votes for a given producer changes, the producer's speed in the race changes and thus
    * his projected finishing time changes. In this event, the stats must be updated: first, the producer's position is
    * updated to reflect his progress since the last stats update to the current race time; second, the producer's
    * projected finishing time based on his new position and speed are updated so we know where he shakes out in the
    * new projected finish times.
    *
    * @warning Do not update these values directly; use @ref updateVotes instead!

/**
 * @brief The ProxyVoteObject tracks proxied votes
 * 
 * This object is created when an account indicates that it wishes to allow other accounts to proxy their votes to it,
 * so that the proxying accounts add their stake to the proxy target's votes.
 * 
 * When an account S proxies its votes to an account P, we look up the @ref ProxyVoteObject with @ref proxyTarget P, 
 * and add S to the @ref proxySources, and add S's stake to @proxiedStake. We then update @ref proxyTarget's votes, to 
 * account for the change in its voting weight. Any time S's stake changes, we update the @ref proxiedStake accordingly. 
 * If S terminates its vote delegation to P, we remove S and its stake from @ref proxySources and @ref proxiedStake, 
 * then update @ref proxyTarget's votes. If P stops accepting proxied votes, then its @ref ProxyVoteObject is removed 
 * and all accounts listed in @ref proxySources revert back to an unproxied voting state.
 * 
 * Whenever any account A changes its votes, we check if there is some @ref ProxyVoteObject for which A is the target,
 * and if so, we add the @ref proxiedStake to its voting weight.
 * 
 * An account A may only proxy to one account at a time, and if A has proxied its votes to some other account, A may 
 * not cast any other votes until it unproxies its voting power.
