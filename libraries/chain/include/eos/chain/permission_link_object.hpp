    * @brief The permission_link_object class assigns permission_objects to message types
    *
    * This class records the links from contracts and message types within those contracts to permission_objects
    * defined by the user to record the authority required to execute those messages within those contracts. For
    * example, suppose we have a contract called "currency" and that contract defines a message called "transfer".
    * Furthermore, suppose a user, "joe", has a permission level called "money" and joe would like to require that
    * permission level in order for his account to invoke currency.transfer. To do this, joe would create a
    * permission_link_object for his account with "currency" as the code account, "transfer" as the message_type, and
    * "money" as the required_permission. After this, in order to validate, any message to "currency" of type
    * "transfer" that requires joe's approval would require signatures sufficient to satisfy joe's "money" authority.
    *
    * Accounts may set links to individual message types, or may set default permission requirements for all messages
    * to a given contract. To set the default for all messages to a given contract, set @ref message_type to the empty
    * string. When looking up which permission to use, if a link is found for a particular {account, code,
    * message_type} triplet, then the required_permission from that link is used. If no such link is found, but a link
    * is found for {account, code, ""}, then the required_permission from that link is used. If no such link is found,
    * account's active authority is used.
