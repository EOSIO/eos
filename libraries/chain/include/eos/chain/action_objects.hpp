   /**
    *  Maps the permission level on the code to the permission level specififed by owner, when specifying a contract the
    *  contract will specify 1 permission_object per action, and by default the parent of that permission object will be
    *  the active permission of the contract; however, the contract owner could group their actions any way they like.
    *
    *  When it comes time to evaluate whether User can call Action on Contract with UserPermissionLevel the algorithm 
    *  operates as follows:
    *
    *  let scope_permission = action_code.permission
    *  while( ! mapping for (scope_permission / owner )
    *    scope_permission = scope_permission.parent
    *    if( !scope_permission ) 
    *       user permission => active 
    *       break;
    *
    *   Now that we know the required user permission...
    *
    *   while( ! transaction.has( user_permission ) )
    *       user_permission = user_permission.parent
    *       if( !user_permission )
    *          throw invalid permission
