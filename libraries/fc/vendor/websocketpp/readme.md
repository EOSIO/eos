WebSocket++ (0.7.0)
==========================

WebSocket++ is a header only C++ library that implements RFC6455 The WebSocket
Protocol. It allows integrating WebSocket client and server functionality into
C++ programs. It uses interchangeable network transport modules including one
based on raw char buffers, one based on C++ iostreams, and one based on Asio 
(either via Boost or standalone). End users can write additional transport
policies to support other networking or event libraries as needed.

Major Features
==============
* Full support for RFC6455
* Partial support for Hixie 76 / Hybi 00, 07-17 draft specs (server only)
* Message/event based interface
* Supports secure WebSockets (TLS), IPv6, and explicit proxies.
* Flexible dependency management (C++11 Standard Library or Boost)
* Interchangeable network transport modules (raw, iostream, Asio, or custom)
* Portable/cross platform (Posix/Windows, 32/64bit, Intel/ARM/PPC)
* Thread-safe
