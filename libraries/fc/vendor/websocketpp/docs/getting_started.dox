/** \page getting_started Getting Started

WebSocket++ code is available on github at https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp
The official project homepage lives at http://www.zaphoyd.com/websocketpp

The git repository is organized into several directories:

- **docs**: This documentation
- **examples**: Example programs that demonstrate how to build basic versions of some commonly used patterns for WebSocket clients and servers.
- **test**: Unit tests that confirm that the code you have works properly and help detect platform specific issues.
- **tutorials**: Detailed walkthroughs of a select set of the example programs.
- **websocketpp**: All of the library code and default configuration files.

WebSocket++ is a header only library. You can start using it by including the websocketpp source directory in your project's include path and including the appropriate WebSocket++ headers in your program. You may also need to include and/or link to appropriate Boost/system libraries. TODO: More information: Building a program with WebSocket++, Walkthroughs of the example programs

WebSocket++ includes cmake and scons scripts for building the examples and unit tests. Neither system is needed unless you want to build tests or examples in an automated fashion.

__Usage questions__ should be posted to the project mailing list at http://groups.google.com/group/websocketpp/ or the IRC channel (\#websocketpp on freenode).

__Bugs and issues__ should be posted to the project GitHub issues queue: https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp/issues.

__Pull requests__ on GitHub are welcome. Please make them against the `develop` branch.

WebSocket++ is written and maintained by Peter Thorson. You can contact me via GitHub messaging, IRC, or via email at websocket@zaphoyd.com.
