/*
 * A reliable_amqp_publisher manages a connection to a single AMQP server that publishes messages to an exchange
 * in a reliable manner: connections to the AMQP server are retried, publishing occurs in a transaction,
 * and unconfirmed messages are kept in a queue that is persisted to disk on destruction.
 *
 * Be aware that the reliable_amqp_publisher will NOT create the exchange. It requires the exchange
 * to already exist. Publishing to a non-existing exchange will effectively block
 * reliable_amqp_publisher's queue until the exchange exists because the queue will be unable to make progress.
 *
 * At a large enough uncomfirmed queue depth (currently on the order of 1 million entries) reliable_amqp_publisher
 * will start dropping messages after logging an error.
